DILL AND WALNUT PESTO

Goes fantastically well with boiled potatoes, carrots, and white fish.\

~140g walnuts\
2 cups dill\
2 cups parsley (or more dill:parsley)\
1 clove garlic\
½ cup o/o\
½ t salt\

Small quantity parmigiano (?25g?)\

Grind the walnuts first in the mixer, before adding the greenery, salt, and sliced garlic. Add oil and pulse briefly to make a loose mash. Add parmigiano and more oil if serving immediately; otherwise, pot up in clean jars without cheese, and top with olive oil to preserve. Will keep in fridge for about ten days.
