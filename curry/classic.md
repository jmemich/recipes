## Classico Curry

Fahd (@paintednegative) gets the credit here for putting me onto the holy quintet of curry "basics":

1. Garlic
2. Onion
3. Chili
4. Cumin
5. Coriander

The rest is really to taste, I've just included my personal favourite below.

## Ingredients

- 5 Large onions
- 1 full head of garlic
- Chilis (to taste!)
- Spices
    - Cumin
    - Coriander
    - Tumeric
    (ratio here is 4:3:2)
- Large can of plum tomatoes
- ~1/2 tub of full fat greek yogurt
- ~4 large(ish) potatoes
- 2 decently sized tomatoes
- an eggplant

[extra]
- mushrooms? zucchini? meat!? (lamb & chicken are good)

## Cooking

Thickly chop onions and finely cut garlic. Add to *large* pot on low/med heat with vegetable oil base. Add spices (again, ratio here is Cumin 4: Coriander: 3, tumeric 2), in hefty amounts.

Whilst the onions and garlic are sauteeing start cutting up the rest of the veg. As the onions soften first add thickly chopped tomatoes. (If you're using meat, add meat now, and make it sure it browns/cooks appropriately). Add veg and mix. Wait ~5 min, continue stirring. When the contents of the pot all have the same similar tumeric-yellow shade and the liquid in the tomatoes/veg is simmering, add the canned plum tomatoes and yogurt.

Once everything is in the pan, lower the head and stir occasionally, the rest of this now takes ~1.5 hours (the potatoes need the longest). It'll reduce and you'll be left with a great consistency of curry.
