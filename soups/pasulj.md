*(straight from Dejan's mum)*

PASULJ

1l light beans
1l dark beans
dry, smoked ribs (for the vegan version alternatively you take smoked ground paprika as a spice)
 1 onion
2-3 garlic cloves
1 tablespoon ground paprika (or smoked ground paprika for the vegan version)
2 tablespoons tomato paste
rosemary
marjoram
salt
pepper
1 soup cube
a few tablespoons of oil (I always prefer sunflower oil)

While you brown the chopped onion in the oil you open the bean cans, drain them and add the beans to the onion. You add the paprika, stir well and roast gently. You add all other spices and stir as you do. Then you add the ribs and you add water only to the point that everything is covered under it's surface. (Obviously forget about the ribs in the vegan version.) You wait until it boils up and then reduce to a lower temperature and cook it for an hour. Take the ribs out. Mash the beans to thicken the soup to your liking. (You may then cut the rib meat into small pieces and add those back into the soup.)
