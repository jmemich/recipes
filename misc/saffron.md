depends on quality of saffron (best is Italian or Spanish), and overall quantity of risotto being made ( your uncle never stinted;  big on leftovers). if it's 2-4 people you might take 20ish strands, and soak them in warm water (1/2 cup?) as you begin. Saffron is v delicate and you don't want to over-cook it - add after about 5 mins or so.  It also doesn't keep forever so don't buy a lot.
