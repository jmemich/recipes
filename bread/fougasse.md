# Fougasse


(will use standard European measurements which you can translate into US)

- 500g strong bread flour (for you, probably called Canadian bread flour)
- 1 package fast-action dried yeast (about 2 tsp), usually corresponds to this qty flour
- 10 g salt
- 350g + barely warm water
 
Dissolve yeast in warm water.

Whisk flour and salt together in a bowl.

Combine ingredients, adding water to make a wettish dough. You can keep sprinkling a bit more water into the mix if it is very stiff.

Knead about ten minutes until elastic and silky – you will feel a change about halfway when it becomes less resistant. Fold over flaps as you go to lock in air bubbles.

REST about 1.5 hours in a large bowl, covered with a damp cloth, somewhere warm and away from draughts.

After resting, gently divide in two, and on a floured or oiled board/tray, shape into the ‘tree shape’ and use a sharp cutter to make the 4 or 5 fougasse cuts. Brushing the cut sides with oil stops them from re-attaching. Handle lightly. Rest on an oiled tray, for about 10-20 minutes – they will puff up again slightly.

Optional: brush with tapenade or flavoured oil.

Preheat oven to max (450F?) and either use a preheated baking stone or a preheated oven tray. If you have a pizza shovel thing, scatter semolina/flour on surface and slide the first fougasse onto it, and then directly onto the preheated surface.

Bake for about 10 minutes. Lift off the tray and let cool before eating!
