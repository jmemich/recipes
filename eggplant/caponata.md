# Caponata

Sicilian eggplant dish. Not really a pasta sauce, needs a protein (lentils, beans) or a grain (barley, rice) to serve with. Also good with side of yoghurt. Original inspiration from [@ZoeJardiniere](https://twitter.com/ZoeJardiniere), cross-referenced with advice from madre, and a bunch of different recipes found online.

## Ingredients

- 2lbs eggplant
- 3 tomatoes
- 2 onions
- 2 red peppers
- 3 stalks celery
- 5 cloves garlic
- capers
- raisins
- oregano (fresh)
- celery leaves (can pick from stalks!)
- parsley (fresh)
- balsamic vinegar
- olive oil
- salt

## Directions

Cube eggplant. Salt and leave in strainer for approx 10 minutes while chopping other veg. Onions, celery, and garlic finely chopped; red peppers similar size to eggplant. Heat lots of oil to medium heat, throw in eggplant. Leave for approx 10 minutes, stirring occasionaly. When they look translucent, throw in the onion, celery, peppers. Leave for a few minutes to soften, then throw in garlic, capers, and a generous splash of caper brine for salty flavour (also helps deglaze.)

Leave on heat for 5-10 minutes, allowing flavours to mix. Roughly chop tomatoes into large chunks. Finely chop celery leaves and oregano. Throw in tomatoes, raisins, oregano, celery leaves and a splash of balsamic vinegar. Cook for another 10(ish) minutes, adding salt to taste.

Serve with protein / grain of choice.
