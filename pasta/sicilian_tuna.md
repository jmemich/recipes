# Sicilian Tuna Pasta

Note, this isn't sicilian. It's _gestures vaguely_ Southern Italian.

## Ingredients

- 500g pasta
- 2 onions
- 4-6 cloves garlic
- 2 can tuna
- capers
- white wine (Pinot Grigio is my go-to)
- _generous_ quantities of "Italian" (i.e., flat-leaf) parsley
- olive oil
- salt
- pepper

## Directions

Start boiling a big pot of water.

The sauce takes a similar amount of time to cook as the water takes to boil. Start with a decent glug of olive oil. It's the only fat source so don't skimp on it. Finely chop the two onions and throw them in to simmer for approx 10 minutes. Then throw in chopped garlic + capers. Also add a splash of the caper brine for some extra salty taste. Add salt and pepper to taste. Wait 3-5 min for the tastes to combine. Add white wine, leave to cook until you can no longer smell alcohol. Then turn off the head, throw in the canned tuna, and stir.

By now the water will be boiling. Throw in the pasta. Cook for approx 2 minutes less that total time recommended (i.e., pre _al dente_.) Drain pasta water but keep maybe 100ml of it to add back in. Recombine pasta, sauce (as above), pasta water (to taste), and finely chopped fresh parsley. Leave covered for 10-15minutes, stirring occasionaly. Serve with maybe a splash more oil if needed.
