## Background

This was stolen from a Jamie Olive recipe [book](https://www.amazon.com/Jamies-Ministry-Food-Anyone-Learn/dp/0718158482/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8).

## Ingredients

- 2/3 full head of garlic
- 1 large chili (not jalapeno)
- ~5 decently sized tomators
- Large amout of basil (with stalks!)
- 250g long pasta

## Prep & cooking
### prep

Chop up the garlic. Remove seeds from chili & chop finely. Strip leaves from stalks of basil and roughly chop leaves. Set aside leaves and chop stalks finely. Dice tomatoes and set aside.

### cooking
Add chopped garlic, chili and basil stalks to pan with olive oil on medium heat. Start boiling water. When garlic is cooked, at tomatoes and simmer for ~5/10min (burn off a little liquid but keep most of it). Add pasta to boiling water when you add diced tomatoes. Once pasta is finished strain and add sauce. Finish by adding chopped basil leaves.

## Notes

- Angel hair pasta is too thin
- Don't use canned tomatoes. Just don't.
- Some like parmesan; it's unecessary.
