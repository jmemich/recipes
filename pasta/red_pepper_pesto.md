# Red Pepper Pesto

Portion is good for standard box of pasta. (If cooking pasta, serve with parmesan cheese. It tastes *much* better.)

## Ingredients

- 4 red peppers
- garlic (1 clove)
- pine nuts (1-2 tablespoons)
- olive oil
- sundried tomatoes (to taste)

## Recipe

- Bake peppers until slightly charred (~30min @ ~400F). Remove from oven and place in a covered bowl to 'sweat' skins off (ziploc bag + fridge also works). Wait ~20min then peel off skins and set aside.

- Toast pine nuts. Add all ingredients into a blender. Sundried tomatoes can be strong but add depth to sauce so season to taste. Blend.
