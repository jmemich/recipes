## Background

Technically originates from mum, but dad makes the better version.

## Ingredients

- 250g long pasta
- 2 cans of tuna
- 1 can artichoke hearts
- A few cloves of garlic
- Mozarella (to taste)
- Capers (to taste)
- Olives (to taste)

[optional]
- Onions

## Cooking

Super simple: just sautee the garlic, capers and olives for a few minutes in some olive oil. Add the artichoke hearts at the end. Put on the pasta and when finished add everything (chop mozz. into small bits & drain tuna).

## Notes

Get the good tuna. This is really not worth making with shitty canned tuna.

Adding onions is really optional. I've been experimenting without because the onions make this too sweet.
