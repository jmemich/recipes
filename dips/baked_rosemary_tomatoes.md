## Cooking

- 2 panets cherry tomatoes
- ~4 large rosemary sprigs
- 4 mid sized onion
- lots of olive oil


## Cooking

Turn oven onto ~350F (why can I no longer use C...). Cover base of baking try in decent amount of oil but *not* enough to cover cherry tomatoes. Pull rosmary off sprigs, thickly chop onions and add everything to baking try. Put in over for ~1 / 1.5 hours (really, we're looking for when tomatoes get that nice baked/glazed look).
