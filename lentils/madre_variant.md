# Ingredients

- half bag of lentils (~200/250g)
- a couple large onions
- 1/4 pack of finely sliced bacon
- few carrots
- few cloves of garlic
- misc. veg
- stock cube
- parseley
- paprika 
- chili flakes

# Cooking

Throw bacon into pot, should cook itself in own fat. Leave it for a few minutes to grease pan, then add onion chopped inion and carrots. Leave for ~5-10 mins before adding misc. veg and garlic. Add paprika, chili flaks and cook for a few more minutes then take off heat. Ideally, everything (except maybe the bacon) should be a little undercooked at this point.

Bring 1/2 pot of water to boil. Add stock cube, wait until mixed. Add in lentils. Cook for about 10 minutes  until they are soft bit still slightly crunch (i.e., a little undercooked). Place bowl under strainer and pour lentils into strainer, catching the stock in bowl underneath.

Add lentils to bacon + veg mix. Add around 1 cup of stock to lentils + veg and add further paprika (for taste). Wait until stock boils off and lentils are cooked (might need to add more stock). Add salt to taste. 

Serve with liberal amounts of olive oil and parseley.
