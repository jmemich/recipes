# Ingredients

- half bag of lentils (~200/250g)
- a couple large onions
- 1/4 pack of finely sliced bacon
- few carrots
- few cloves of garlic
- misc. veg
- stock cube
- parseley
- paprika 
- chili flakes

# Cooking

[note timing estimates are a little rough. follow directions > exact times.]

Throw bacon into pot, should cook itself in own fat. Leave it for a few minutes to grease pan, then add chopped onion and carrots. Leave for ~5-10 mins before adding misc. veg and garlic. Add paprika, chili flakes and cook for a few more minutes then take off heat. Ideally, everything (except maybe the bacon) should be a little undercooked at this point.

Bring 1/2 pot of water to boil. Add stock cube, wait until mixed. Add in lentils. Cook for about 10-15 minutes until they are soft but still slightly crunchy (i.e., a little undercooked). Place bowl under strainer and pour lentils into strainer, catching the stock in bowl underneath.

Add lentils to bacon + veg mix. Add around 1 cup of stock to lentils and add further paprika (for taste). Wait until stock boils off and lentils are cooked (~5/10mins) (might also need to add more stock). Add salt to taste. 

Serve with liberal amounts of olive oil and finely chopped parseley.
