# Fake Mapo Tofu

Disclaimer: this is mapo tofu *inspired*. The real dish is tastier but also harder to make. Note, easy to make vegan version of this with veggie stock > chicken stock. Note all measurements are approximate and estimated post-hoc.

## Ingredients

- 1 large leek
- 2/3 celery stalks (1:1 with leeks)

## Recipe

1. Toast peppercorns for a few minutes over med heat. Don't burn (o/w they taste bitter). Then grind up in mortar and pestle. Set aside.

2. Chop leeks and celery. Heat vegetable oil (ideally in a wok but any pan will do) and add lao gan ma. Add leeks and celery. Cook for a few minutes but before they soften add ginger, garlic, soy sauce, sesame oil. Cook for a few more minutes then add fake meat. 

3. When the meat is 'brown' add tofu and stock. Add a little sugar, pickle juice (!?) and cornstarch to thicken. Add the crushed peppercorns. Let cook for a few more minutes for sauce to thicken. 

4. Serve over steamed rice with finely chopped scallion for garnish.
